"""
Golden file regression tests: Buy-and-Hold strategy.

Verifies deterministic output by comparing backtest results against
golden files (reference outputs).

These tests ensure:
- Deterministic execution (same inputs â†’ same outputs)
- No regressions in calculations (NAV, PnL, fills)
- Stable API (output format doesn't change unexpectedly)
