"""
Event infrastructure for QTrader event-driven architecture.

This module provides the event system for loose coupling between services:
- Event classes: Immutable Pydantic events validated against JSON Schema contracts
  - BaseEvent: Provides envelope fields only
  - ValidatedEvent: Domain events with payload validation
  - ControlEvent: Barriers/lifecycle (no payload validation)
- EventBus: Publish/subscribe infrastructure for event distribution
- EventStore: Persistent event storage for audit trail and replay

Events enable:
- Services to communicate without direct dependencies
- Multiple consumers per event (one-to-many)
- Audit trail and replay capability
- Deterministic backtesting
- Causality tracking via correlation_id and causation_id

SIMPLIFIED event system focused on data events and control events.
Other events (signals, orders, fills, portfolio) to be added as services are rebuilt.
