# Example RiskService Configuration
#
# This file demonstrates how to configure the RiskService for a multi-strategy
# portfolio with different risk allocation, position sizing, and limit controls.

# Strategy Budgets: Define how equity is allocated across strategies
# - strategy_id: Unique identifier for the strategy
# - capital_weight: Fraction of available equity allocated to this strategy
#   (must sum to 1.0 across all strategies)
budgets:
  - strategy_id: momentum_v1
    capital_weight: 0.6 # 60% of equity

  - strategy_id: mean_reversion_v1
    capital_weight: 0.4 # 40% of equity

# Position Sizing: Define sizing model and parameters per strategy
# Each strategy can have different sizing aggressiveness
sizing:
  momentum_v1:
    model: fixed_fraction # Only model supported in Phase 4 MVP
    fraction: 0.03 # Risk 3% of allocated capital per position

  mean_reversion_v1:
    model: fixed_fraction
    fraction: 0.02 # More conservative: 2% per position

# Concentration Limit: Maximum exposure to any single symbol
# Prevents over-concentration in one stock
concentration:
  max_position_pct:
    0.10 # No more than 10% of equity in one symbol
    # (applies to absolute value: |position_value| / equity)

# Leverage Limits: Portfolio-level exposure constraints
# Gross = sum(|position_value|) / equity
# Net = sum(position_value) / equity (considering long/short direction)
leverage:
  max_gross: 2.0 # Allow up to 200% gross exposure (e.g., 150% long + 50% short)
  max_net: 1.0 # But net exposure capped at 100% (fully invested long, or balanced)

# Cash Buffer: Reserve fraction of equity as cash
# Useful for margin requirements, rebalancing, or unexpected needs
cash_buffer_pct: 0.02 # Reserve 2% cash (don't allocate to strategies)

# Example Interpretation:
# - Portfolio equity: $1,000,000
# - Cash buffer: $1,000,000 * 0.02 = $20,000 reserved
# - Available for allocation: $980,000
# - Momentum strategy gets: $980,000 * 0.6 = $588,000
# - Mean reversion gets: $980,000 * 0.4 = $392,000
# - Each momentum position: $588,000 * 0.03 = $17,640 target notional
# - Each mean reversion position: $392,000 * 0.02 = $7,840 target notional
# - Max position in any symbol: $1,000,000 * 0.10 = $100,000
# - Total portfolio exposure: Limited to $2,000,000 gross, $1,000,000 net
