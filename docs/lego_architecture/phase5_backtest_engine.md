# Phase 5: BacktestEngine Implementation (Event-Driven Orchestrator)

## Overview

**Goal:** Create a pure event-driven orchestration engine (\<200 lines) that coordinates all services via EventBus. No business logic, no direct service callsâ€”just event publishing and timing control.

**Start Date:** October 21, 2025\
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks\
**Status:** ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS**\
**Complexity:** High\
**Priority:** Critical - Ties everything together

**Key Principle:** BacktestEngine publishes orchestration events. Services subscribe, process, and publish their own events. Engine never touches service state directly.

______________________________________________________________________

## Architecture Philosophy

**Event-Driven Everything:**

- BacktestEngine = Pure orchestrator (publishes timing/coordination events)
- Services = Independent subscribers/publishers
- No direct service calls
- No shared state
- Services own their internal state

**Master Config Pattern:**

- Single `backtest.yaml` configuration
- Each service gets its config section
- Services instantiated via `from_config()` factory methods
- Easy to version, test, and swap configurations

**Service State Ownership:**

- Each service maintains internal state
- Services publish state change events when relevant
- Other services cache what they need
- BacktestEngine never reads or modifies service state

### Master Configuration Structure

# config/backtest.yaml
backtest:

## Event Loop Flow (Event-Driven)

### High-Level Flow

```
1. Load Configuration
   - Parse backtest.yaml
   - Instantiate services via from_config()
   - Wire all services to EventBus

2. Initialization Phase
   - Publish BacktestStartEvent
   - Services initialize (load data, set up state)

3. Warmup Phase (if warmup_bars > 0)
   - Iterate through warmup bars
   - Publish BarEvent for each bar
   - Services process bars (build indicators)
   - NO signal generation (strategies lack data)

4. Main Trading Loop
   - For each bar in [start_date, end_date]:
     a. Publish BarEvent (per symbol)
     b. Publish ValuationTriggerEvent
     c. Publish RiskEvaluationTriggerEvent
     d. (Services handle everything via subscriptions)

5. Finalization Phase
   - Publish BacktestEndEvent
   - Services finalize (close positions, generate reports)
   - Return BacktestResult

6. Reporting
   - Services publish or save their outputs
   - Optional: ReportingService aggregates
```

### Detailed Event Flow (Per Bar)

```python
# BacktestEngine main loop (simplified)
for ts, multi_bar in self._data.get_bars(self._start, self._end):
    # Step 1: Publish bar events (all services receive)
    for symbol, bar in multi_bar.items():
        self._event_bus.publish(
            BarEvent(
                symbol=symbol,
                bar=bar,
                ts=ts,
                is_warmup=False  # or True during warmup
            )
        )

    # What happens automatically via subscriptions:
    # â†’ PortfolioService.on_bar(): updates position values with latest prices
    # â†’ ExecutionService.on_bar(): checks pending orders, attempts fills
    #     - If filled: publishes FillEvent
    # â†’ StrategyService.on_bar(): routes bar to each strategy
    #     - Each strategy processes bar independently
    #     - If signal conditions met: publishes SignalEvent
    # â†’ RiskService.on_signal(): buffers incoming signals

    # â†’ PortfolioService.on_fill(): applies fills to positions

    # Step 2: Trigger portfolio valuation
    self._event_bus.publish(ValuationTriggerEvent(ts=ts))

    # â†’ PortfolioService.on_valuation_trigger(): calculates portfolio metrics
    #     - Publishes PortfolioStateEvent with equity, positions, cash, etc.
    # â†’ RiskService.on_portfolio_state(): caches latest portfolio state

    # Step 3: Trigger risk evaluation (batch process all buffered signals)
    self._event_bus.publish(RiskEvaluationTriggerEvent(ts=ts))

    # â†’ RiskService.on_risk_evaluation_trigger():
    #     - Evaluates all buffered signals at once
    #     - Sizes positions based on allocated capital
    #     - Checks concentration & leverage limits
    #     - Publishes OrderApprovedEvent (per approved signal)
    #     - Publishes OrderRejectedEvent (per rejected signal)
    #     - Clears signal buffer

    # â†’ ExecutionService.on_order_approved():
    #     - Creates OrderEvent
    #     - Adds to pending order book
    #     - Will fill on next bar (when symbol's BarEvent arrives)
```

## Service Updates Required

### PortfolioService (Phase 2)

**New Methods:**

- `on_bar(event: BarEvent)` - Update position values
- `on_valuation_trigger(event: ValuationTriggerEvent)` - Calculate metrics, publish state

**Changes:**

- Remove direct API calls
- Add event subscriptions in `__init__`
- Publish `PortfolioStateEvent` instead of returning state

### ExecutionService (Phase 3)

**New Attributes:**

- `_pending_orders: dict[str, OrderEvent]` - Internal order book

**New Methods:**

- `on_order_approved(event: OrderApprovedEvent)` - Queue approved orders
- `on_bar(event: BarEvent)` - Check pending orders, attempt fills

**Changes:**

- Remove `submit_order()` direct API
- Add event subscriptions in `__init__`
- Publish `FillEvent` instead of returning fills

### RiskService (Phase 4)

**New Subscriptions:**

- `PortfolioStateEvent` â†’ cache portfolio state (already done in Phase 4)

**Verification:**

- Ensure batch evaluation still works with `RiskEvaluationTriggerEvent`
- Test with real `PortfolioStateEvent` data

### StrategyService (NEW)

**Purpose:** Load and orchestrate multiple external strategy files

**Responsibilities:**

- Load `.py` files containing `Strategy` + `StrategyConfig`
- Instantiate strategy objects
- Route `BarEvent` to each strategy
- Strategies publish `SignalEvent` independently

**Interface:**

```python
class IStrategyService(Protocol):
    def on_bar(self, event: BarEvent) -> None:
        """Route bar to all strategies."""

    def on_backtest_start(self, event: BacktestStartEvent) -> None:
        """Initialize all strategies."""

    def on_backtest_end(self, event: BacktestEndEvent) -> None:
        """Finalize all strategies."""
```

### DataService (Phase 1)

**No Changes Required:**

- Already provides `get_bars()` iterator
- Already handles bar alignment
- Just needs to be accessed by BacktestEngine

______________________________________________________________________

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Event-Driven?

1. **Decoupling:** Services never depend on each other directly
1. **Testability:** Each service can be tested in isolation
1. **Extensibility:** Add new services without modifying existing ones
1. **Clarity:** Event flow is explicit and auditable
1. **Consistency:** Matches Phase 4 RiskService pattern

### Why Batch Signal Evaluation?

1. **Consistency:** All signals evaluated with same portfolio state
1. **Atomic Time:** All events at timestamp `ts` are consistent
1. **Realistic:** Real trading processes orders at discrete times
1. **Performance:** Batch operations more efficient than per-signal
1. **Already Works:** Phase 4 RiskService proven architecture

### Why Master Config Pattern?

1. **Single Source of Truth:** All settings in one place
1. **Version Control:** Easy to track backtest configurations
1. **Testability:** Swap configs for different test scenarios
1. **Documentation:** Config file is self-documenting
1. **Flexibility:** Each service handles its own config section

### Why Services Own State?

1. **Encapsulation:** Services control their internal state
1. **Independence:** No shared mutable state between services
1. **Testability:** Services can be tested with mock state
1. **Clarity:** State ownership is explicit
1. **Safety:** No accidental state corruption

### Why StrategyService?

1. **Orchestration:** Manages multiple strategies uniformly
1. **Loading:** Handles external `.py` file loading
1. **Routing:** Distributes bars to all strategies
1. **Independence:** Strategies don't know about each other
1. **Scalability:** Easy to add/remove strategies

- Strategy optimization/parameter search (Future)
- Risk metrics calculation (Future - separate service)
