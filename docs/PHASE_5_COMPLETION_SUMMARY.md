# Phase 5: Execution Engine Update - Completion Summary

**Date**: October 9, 2025\
**Milestone**: Execution Engine Migration to CanonicalBar\
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (Integrated as part of Phase 4)

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 (Execution Engine Update) was **successfully completed as part of Phase 4** and is now fully operational with all tests passing. The original plan called for updating the execution engine to work with `CanonicalBar`, but this was accomplished during Phase 4 Part 4 (October 8, 2025) when the execution engine was migrated to use the new data models.

**Key Achievement**: All 321 tests passing, including the critical `test_split_accounting.py` which validates Phase 5 architecture (unadjusted execution with splits).

## What Was Phase 5?

According to the migration plan (`DATA_LAYER_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`), Phase 5 objectives were:

1. Update `ExecutionEngine.on_bar()` to work with `CanonicalBar`
1. Use unadjusted mode for realistic fills
1. Update dividend processing
1. Ensure commissions calculated on actual traded prices

## Current Status: ✅ ALL OBJECTIVES COMPLETE

### 1. ExecutionEngine Updated ✅

**File**: `src/qtrader/execution/engine.py`

**Current Signature**:

```python
def on_bar(
    self,
    bar: CanonicalBar,              # ✅ Using CanonicalBar
    symbol: str,
    ts: datetime,
    next_bar: Optional[CanonicalBar] = None,
    is_close_only: bool = False,
) -> List[Fill]:
    """
    Process bar and generate fills (Phase 4 CanonicalBar architecture).

    Args:
        bar: Current bar to process (CanonicalBar - no symbol/ts fields)
        symbol: Symbol for this bar (from MultiModeBar)
        ts: Timestamp for this bar (parsed from trade_datetime)
        next_bar: Next bar (for market orders, optional)
        is_close_only: True if bar is market close

    Returns:
        List of fills generated during this bar
    """
```

**Key Features**:

- ✅ Uses `CanonicalBar` directly (not nested multi-series)
- ✅ Direct field access: `bar.high`, `bar.low`, `bar.close`
- ✅ Proper Decimal conversion for price fields
- ✅ Participation tracking with actual volumes
- ✅ Fill price deviation checks

### 2. Unadjusted Execution Implemented ✅

**File**: `src/qtrader/api/backtest.py`

**Implementation**:

```python
# Extract unadjusted bar for execution (Phase 5 architecture)
unadjusted_bar = multi_mode_bar.unadjusted
next_unadjusted_bar = bars_list[bar_idx + 1][1].unadjusted if bar_idx + 1 < len(bars_list) else None

# Parse timestamp and symbol from MultiModeBar
bar_ts = datetime.fromisoformat(multi_mode_bar.trade_datetime)
symbol = multi_mode_bar.symbol

# Execution engine processes unadjusted bar (realistic fills at actual prices)
fills = self.execution_engine.on_bar(
    bar=unadjusted_bar,        # ✅ Actual traded prices
    symbol=symbol,
    ts=bar_ts,
    next_bar=next_unadjusted_bar,
    is_close_only=False,
)
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Fills at actual historical prices (not split-adjusted)
- ✅ Realistic commission calculations
- ✅ Correct participation rates (based on actual volume)
- ✅ Accurate slippage modeling

### 3. Dividend Processing Updated ✅

**File**: `src/qtrader/api/backtest.py`

**Implementation**:

```python
# Process dividends (use unadjusted amounts - actual cash payments)
if unadjusted_bar.dividend:
    self.portfolio.apply_long_dividend(
        symbol=symbol,
        dividend_per_share=unadjusted_bar.dividend,  # ✅ Unadjusted amount
        payment_date=bar_ts,
    )
    logger.info(
        "backtest.dividend_received",
        symbol=symbol,
        amount=float(unadjusted_bar.dividend),
        bar_date=bar_ts.isoformat(),
    )
```

**Legacy Code Removed**:

- ❌ `src/qtrader/execution/dividend_calculator.py` (142 lines) - DELETED
- ❌ `src/qtrader/execution/dividend_processor.py` (308 lines) - DELETED
- ❌ Associated test files - DELETED

**Total**: ~450 lines of legacy dividend code removed

### 4. Commission Accuracy ✅

**Example Scenario**: Stock split 4:1

**Before (Incorrect)**:

```python
# Using adjusted prices
adjusted_price = $25.00  # Split-adjusted
commission = $25.00 × 100 shares × 0.001 = $2.50  # ✗ WRONG
```

**After (Correct)**:

```python
# Using unadjusted prices
unadjusted_price = $100.00  # Actual traded price
commission = $100.00 × 100 shares × 0.001 = $10.00  # ✓ CORRECT
```

**Validation**: Confirmed in `test_split_accounting.py`:

- Buy: 1 share @ $498.00 → Commission: $1.00 ✅
- Sell: 4 shares @ $129.00 → Commission: $1.00 ✅
- Total fees: $2.00 (correct based on actual traded prices)

## Test Results

### All Tests Passing ✅

```bash
$ pytest tests/ -x -q --tb=no
321 passed, 6 skipped, 1 warning in 0.86s
```

### Execution-Specific Tests ✅

```bash
$ pytest tests/ -k "execution" -v
54 passed, 273 deselected, 1 warning in 0.53s
```

**Test Coverage**:

- ✅ `test_engine.py` (9 tests) - Core execution logic
- ✅ `test_commission.py` (10 tests) - Commission calculations
- ✅ `test_limit_stop.py` (19 tests) - Order types
- ✅ `test_participation.py` (9 tests) - Volume constraints
- ✅ `test_backtest_full_execution.py` (5 tests) - Integration tests
- ✅ `test_split_accounting.py` (1 test) - Phase 5 validation

### Critical Phase 5 Test: Split Accounting ✅

**File**: `tests/test_split_accounting.py`

**Test Scenario**:

```
Timeline:
- Bar 1: Buy 1 share @ $498 (unadjusted)
- Bar 2: Dividend $0.82 (unadjusted) × 1 share = $0.82
- Bar 3: Split 4:1 (position becomes 4 shares @ $124.50 cost basis)
- Bar 4: Generate SELL signal for 4 shares
- Bar 5: Execute SELL at $129 (unadjusted post-split)

Expected Result:
- Buy:      -$498.00
- Dividend: +$0.82
- Split:    1 → 4 shares, cost basis $498 → $124.50/share
- Sell:     +$516.00 (4 × $129)
- Fees:     -$2.00
- Net P&L:  +$16.82 ✅
```

**Test Output**:

```
=== Backtest Results ===
Final cash: $10016.82
Final equity: $10016.82
Total fills: 2

Buy fill: 1 shares @ $498.00
Sell fill: 4 shares @ $129.00
Final position: 0 shares

P&L: $16.82
```

**Status**: ✅ **PASSING**

This test validates:

- ✅ Execution uses unadjusted prices
- ✅ Split processing works correctly
- ✅ Cost basis preserved through split
- ✅ EXIT signals sell all shares
- ✅ Commissions calculated correctly
- ✅ P&L positive (as expected)

## Code Quality Metrics

### Lines Changed

**Modified Files** (Phase 4 Part 4):

```
src/qtrader/execution/engine.py       ~150 lines modified
src/qtrader/execution/fill_policy.py  ~10 lines modified
src/qtrader/api/backtest.py           ~100 lines modified (execution integration)
```

**Deleted Files** (Legacy cleanup):

```
src/qtrader/execution/dividend_calculator.py      142 lines
src/qtrader/execution/dividend_processor.py       308 lines
tests/unit/execution/test_dividend_calculator.py  ~50 lines
tests/unit/execution/test_dividend_processor.py   ~50 lines

Total removed: ~550 lines
```

**Net Result**: Code simplified while adding functionality

### Type Safety

**Decimal Conversions** (4 critical points):

```python
# 1. Portfolio price updates
self.portfolio.update_prices({symbol: Decimal(str(bar.close))})

# 2. Fill generation
fill_price = Decimal(str(bar.high))

# 3. Deviation checks
fill_price_decimal = Decimal(str(fill_price))

# 4. Split detection
adjustment_ratio = Decimal(str(unadjusted_bar.close)) / Decimal(str(bar.close))
```

**Rationale**: `CanonicalBar` uses `float` for prices (Pydantic), but portfolio uses `Decimal` for precision. Explicit conversion prevents accumulation of floating-point errors.

### Direct Field Access

**Before (Phase 3)**:

```python
# Nested access
high = bar.unadjusted.high
low = bar.unadjusted.low
close = bar.unadjusted.close
```

**After (Phase 5)**:

```python
# Direct access
high = bar.high
low = bar.low
close = bar.close
```

**Benefits**:

- Simpler code
- Fewer indirection levels
- Clearer intent
- Easier to debug

## Architecture Validation

### Multi-Mode Architecture Working ✅

```python
# In backtest.py - Component-specific mode selection

# 1. Strategy receives adjusted (for indicators)
strategy_bar = multi_mode_bar.adjusted
signals = self.strategy.on_bar(strategy_bar, ctx)

# 2. Execution uses unadjusted (for fills)
execution_bar = multi_mode_bar.unadjusted
fills = self.execution_engine.on_bar(execution_bar, symbol, ts)

# 3. Performance tracking (future: total_return for dividends)
# perf_bar = multi_mode_bar.total_return
```

**Configuration**:

```yaml
data:
  signal_generation_mode: "adjusted"      # ✅ Implemented
  execution_mode: "unadjusted"            # ✅ Implemented
  performance_mode: "total_return"        # ⏳ Future (Phase 6)
```

### Data Flow Validated ✅

## Original Plan vs Actual Implementation

### Phase 5 Original Plan

From `DATA_LAYER_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`:

| Task                            | Status      | Notes                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Update ExecutionEngine.on_bar() | ✅ Complete | Done in Phase 4 Part 4      |
| Use unadjusted mode for fills   | ✅ Complete | Implemented in backtest.py  |
| Update dividend processing      | ✅ Complete | Integrated in backtest loop |
| Update FillPolicy               | ✅ Complete | Updated for CanonicalBar    |
| Unit tests updated              | ✅ Complete | 54 execution tests passing  |

### Why Phase 5 Was Completed in Phase 4

**Reason**: The execution engine migration required updating both:

1. **ExecutionEngine.on_bar()** signature (Phase 5 task)
1. **Backtest.run()** integration (Phase 4 task)

These were interdependent and couldn't be done separately, so they were completed together in Phase 4 Part 4 (October 8, 2025).

**Result**: Phase 5 objectives achieved ahead of schedule.

## Benefits Realized

### 1. Realistic Execution ✅

**Commission Accuracy**:

- ✅ Calculated on actual traded prices (not split-adjusted)
- ✅ Validated with AAPL split scenario
- ✅ P&L matches expected values

**Fill Price Realism**:

- ✅ Market orders fill at next bar open (actual price)
- ✅ Limit orders respect high/low (actual intraday range)
- ✅ Participation rates based on actual volume

### 2. Split Handling ✅

**Position Adjustment**:

- ✅ Quantity updated correctly (1 → 4 shares for 4:1 split)
- ✅ Cost basis preserved ($498 → $124.50/share)
- ✅ Commissions based on pre-split price

**Indicator Consistency**:

- ✅ Strategy uses adjusted prices (no split discontinuities)
- ✅ Technical indicators work across splits
- ✅ Signals generated correctly

### 3. Code Simplification ✅

**Metrics**:

- ✅ ~550 lines of legacy code removed
- ✅ Direct field access (no nested tuples)
- ✅ Type-safe conversions (float → Decimal)
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

**Maintainability**:

- ✅ Easier to understand (simpler data structures)
- ✅ Easier to debug (clear data flow)
- ✅ Easier to extend (add new order types)

## Outstanding Items

### Phase 5: ✅ NONE - All Complete

Phase 5 objectives are 100% complete. All execution engine functionality is working correctly with the new data models.

### Future Work (Not Phase 5)

**Phase 6: Portfolio Update** (future):

- Use `total_return` mode for performance metrics
- Include dividend reinvestment in returns
- Update performance analytics

**Phase 7: Test Suite Migration** (future):

- Update remaining test fixtures
- Migrate strategy examples
- Update documentation

**Phase 8: Documentation** (future):

- Update user guides
- Add migration examples
- Update API reference

**Phase 9: Cleanup** (future):

- Remove legacy adapters
- Archive old documentation
- Final code review

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Interdependent Phases

**Challenge**: Phase 4 (Backtest) and Phase 5 (Execution) were tightly coupled.

**Solution**: Combined into Phase 4 Part 4 for efficiency.

**Outcome**: ✅ Both completed together without issues.

### 2. Type Conversion Strategy

**Challenge**: `CanonicalBar` uses `float`, Portfolio uses `Decimal`.

**Solution**: Explicit conversion at boundary points.

**Outcome**: ✅ No precision loss, clear conversion points.

### 3. Test-First Migration

**Challenge**: How to validate execution engine changes?

**Solution**: Created `test_split_accounting.py` first, then fixed code to pass.

**Outcome**: ✅ Clear success criteria, validated end-to-end.

### 4. Legacy Code Removal

**Challenge**: When to remove old dividend processor?

**Solution**: Remove immediately after confirming new approach works.

**Outcome**: ✅ Cleaner codebase, less confusion.

## Validation Summary
