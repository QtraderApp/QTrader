## Implementation Details

### 1. LotTracker Matching (`src/qtrader/services/portfolio/lot_tracker.py`)

**FIFO Matching (`match_close_long`)**:

- Uses `deque.popleft()` to close oldest lots first
- Handles full and partial lot closes
- Returns list of `(Lot, quantity_closed)` tuples
- Creates "\_remaining" lots when partially closed
- Validates sufficient quantity available

**LIFO Matching (`match_close_short`)**:

- Uses `list.pop()` to close newest lots first
- Handles negative quantities (shorts)
- Returns list of `(Lot, quantity_closed)` tuples
- Creates "\_remaining" lots when partially closed
- Validates sufficient quantity available

**Key Features**:

- Partial Close Logic: Splits lots and creates new lot with "\_remaining" suffix
- Entry Commission Handling: "\_remaining" lots have `entry_commission=0` (already paid)
- Validation: Rejects zero/negative quantities, insufficient quantity

### 2. PortfolioService Closing (`src/qtrader/services/portfolio/service.py`)

**Close Long Position (`_close_long_position`)**:

```python
# Realized P&L formula:
pnl = (exit_price - entry_price) * quantity - (entry_commission + exit_commission)

# Both commissions are allocated proportionally:
exit_commission = commission * (qty_closed / total_quantity)
entry_commission = lot.entry_commission * (qty_closed / lot.quantity)
```

**Close Short Position (`_close_short_position`)**:

```python
# Realized P&L formula (reversed):
pnl = (entry_price - exit_price) * quantity - (entry_commission + exit_commission)

# Commission allocation handles negative quantities:
exit_commission = commission * (qty_closed / total_quantity)
entry_commission = lot.entry_commission * (abs(qty_closed) / abs(lot.quantity))
```

**Cash Flow**:

- Close long (sell): `cash += (price * quantity - commission)`
- Close short (buy to cover): `cash -= (price * quantity + commission)`

**Position Updates**:

- Removes closed lots from `position.lots`
- Adds any remaining partial lots
- Recalculates `total_cost` and `avg_price` from remaining lots
- Updates `position.quantity`

**Apply Fill Routing**:

```python
if is_buy and not has_short:
    _open_long_position()  # Buy = open long
elif is_sell and not has_long:
    _open_short_position()  # Sell = open short
elif is_sell and has_long:
    _close_long_position()  # Sell existing long = close FIFO
elif is_buy and has_short:
    _close_short_position()  # Buy to cover short = close LIFO
```

### 3. Realized P&L Tracking

**Cumulative Tracking**:

- Added `self._cumulative_realized_pnl` attribute to service
- Updated on every close operation
- Persisted across position lifecycle (open → close → reopen)

**Query Methods**:

```python
# Total realized P&L across all symbols
service.get_realized_pnl()

# Per-symbol realized P&L
service.get_realized_pnl(symbol="AAPL")
```

**Ledger Integration**:

- Close operations create ledger entries with `realized_pnl` field
- Includes lot_ids that were closed
- Description indicates "FIFO close" or "LIFO close"

## Key Implementation Insights

### 1. Commission Handling Discovery

**Initial Implementation Issue**:

- Only subtracted exit commission from realized P&L
- Result: P&L was $10 higher than expected per 100 shares

**Corrected Implementation**:

- Both entry and exit commissions must be allocated proportionally
- Entry commission comes from `lot.entry_commission`
- Exit commission comes from the closing fill
- Formula: `total_commissions = entry_commission_allocation + exit_commission_allocation`

**Example**:

```python
# Buy 100 @ $150 + $10 commission
# Sell 100 @ $160 - $10 commission
# Correct P&L: (160-150)*100 - ($10+$10) = $980 ✅
# Wrong P&L: (160-150)*100 - $10 = $990 ❌
```

### 2. Remaining Lot Commission Strategy

**Design Decision**: When a lot is partially closed, the "\_remaining" lot has `entry_commission=Decimal("0")`.

**Rationale**:

- The original entry commission was already paid when the lot was opened
- It gets proportionally allocated across all closes of that lot
- Remaining lots shouldn't "re-charge" commission

**Example**:

```python
# Buy 200 @ $150 + $20 commission (lot_001)
#
# Close 1: Sell 50 @ $155 - $5
#   Entry commission: $20 * (50/200) = $5
#   Exit commission: $5
#   P&L: (155-150)*50 - ($5+$5) = $240
#   Creates: lot_001_remaining (150 shares, entry_commission=$0)
#
# Close 2: Sell 75 @ $160 - $7.50
#   Entry commission: $20 * (75/200) = $7.50  (from original lot)
#   Exit commission: $7.50
#   P&L: (160-150)*75 - ($7.50+$7.50) = $735
```

### 3. FIFO/LIFO Data Structures

**Long Positions (FIFO)**:

- `deque` for efficient `popleft()` operations
- Oldest lot at front, newest at back
- Partial close: `popleft()`, process, `appendleft(_remaining)`

**Short Positions (LIFO)**:

- `list` for efficient `pop()` operations
- Oldest lot at front, newest at back
- Partial close: `pop()`, process, `append(_remaining)`

## Integration with Existing System

### Week 1 Compatibility

All 15 Week 1 tests continue to pass after Week 2 changes:

- Opening positions unchanged
- Input validation unchanged
- Price updates unchanged
- Ledger operations compatible

### New Capabilities

Week 2 enables:

- **Position Management**: Full lifecycle (open → close → reopen)
- **Performance Tracking**: Realized P&L per symbol and total
- **Tax Reporting**: Lot-level cost basis tracking (FIFO/LIFO)
- **Risk Management**: Know exact entry prices and costs per lot

## Next Steps: Week 3

Based on the established architecture, Week 3 should focus on:

1. **Complex Position Operations**:

   - Reverse positions (close long 100, open short 50 in one fill)
   - Average down/up scenarios
   - Position netting rules

1. **Advanced P&L Features**:

   - Unrealized P&L calculations per lot
   - Time-weighted returns
   - P&L attribution (price vs quantity)

1. **Risk Metrics**:

   - Position exposure calculations
   - Leverage tracking
   - Margin requirements (if applicable)

1. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - Bulk fill processing
   - Efficient lot matching for large positions
   - Ledger query performance
